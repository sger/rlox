//   - block comments:    /* ... */

This block comment spans multiple lines.
It should increment the scanner's line counter.
The next token after this comment should have a line number
that accounts for these newlines.

Outer block start
  /* Inner block A */

  /* another nested block if nesting is on */
  end markers: */  (the scanner should close at the correct time)
